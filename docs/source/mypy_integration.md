# Mypy

*new in 0.8.0*

Pandera integrates with mypy to provide static type-linting of dataframes,
relying on [pandas-stubs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs)
for typing information.

```bash
pip install pandera[mypy]
```

Then enable the plugin in your `mypy.ini` or `setug.cfg` file:

```
[mypy]
plugins = pandera.mypy
```

:::{note}
Mypy static type-linting is supported for only pandas dataframes.
:::

:::{warning}
This functionality is experimental ðŸ§ª. Since the
[pandas-stubs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs) type stub
annotations don't always match the official
[pandas effort to support type annotations](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/28142#issuecomment-991967009),
installing the `pandera[mypy]` extra may yield false positives in your
pandas code, many of which are are documented in `tests/mypy/modules`
(see [here](https://github.com/unionai-oss/pandera/tree/main/tests/mypy/modules) ).

We encourage you to [file an issue](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug,mypy&template=bug_report.md&title=)
if you find any false positives or negatives being reported by `mypy`.
A list of such issues can be found [here](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera/labels/mypy).
We'll most likely have to escalate this to the official `pandas-stubs`
[issues](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues).
:::

In the example below, we define a few schemas to see how type-linting with
pandera works.

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 8-27
```

The mypy linter will complain if the output type of the function body doesn't
match the function's return signature.

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 30-43
```

It'll also complain if the input type doesn't match the expected input type.
Note that we're using the {py:class}`pandera.typing.pandas.DataFrame` generic
type to define dataframes that are validated against the
{py:class}`~pandera.api.pandas.model.DataFrameModel` type variable on initialization.

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 47-60
```

To make mypy happy with respect to the return type, you can either initialize
a dataframe of the expected type:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 63-64
```

:::{note}
If you use the approach above with the {py:func}`~pandera.check_types`
decorator, pandera will do its best to not to validate the dataframe twice
if it's already been initialized with the
`DataFrame[Schema](**data)` syntax.
:::

Or use {py:func}`typing.cast` to indicate to mypy that the return value of
the function is of the correct type.

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 67-68
```

## Limitations

An important caveat to static type-linting with pandera dataframe types is that,
since pandas dataframes are mutable objects, there's no way for `mypy` to
know whether a mutated instance of a
{py:class}`~pandera.api.pandas.model.DataFrameModel`-typed dataframe has the correct
contents. Fortunately, we can simply rely on the {py:func}`~pandera.check_types`
decorator to verify that the output dataframe is valid.

Consider the examples below:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 63-80
```

Even though the outputs of these functions are incorrect, mypy doesn't catch
the error during static type-linting but pandera will raise a
{py:class}`~pandera.errors.SchemaError` or {py:class}`~pandera.errors.SchemaErrors`
exception at runtime, depending on whether you're doing
{ref}`lazy validation <lazy-validation>` or not.

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/mypy/modules/pandas_dataframe.py
:lines: 83-87
```
