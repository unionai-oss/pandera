        """Perform a hypothesis test on a Series or DataFrame.

        :param test: The hypothesis test function. It should take one or more
            arrays as positional arguments and return a test statistic and a
            p-value. The arrays passed into the test function are determined
            by the ``samples`` argument.
        :param samples: for `Column` or `SeriesSchema` hypotheses, this refers
            to the group keys in the `groupby` column(s) used to group the
            `Series` into a dict of `Series`. The `samples` column(s) are
            passed into the `test` function as positional arguments.

            For `DataFrame`-level hypotheses, `samples` refers to a column or
            multiple columns to pass into the `test` function. The `samples`
            column(s) are passed into the `test`  function as positional
            arguments.
        :param groupby: If a string or list of strings is provided, then these
            columns are used to group the Column Series by `groupby`. If a
            callable is passed, the expected signature is
            DataFrame -> DataFrameGroupby. The function has access to the
            entire dataframe, but the Column.name is selected from this
            DataFrameGroupby object so that a SeriesGroupBy object is passed
            into the `hypothesis_check` function.

            Specifying this argument changes the `fn` signature to:
            dict[str|tuple[str], Series] -> bool|pd.Series[bool]

            Where specific groups can be obtained from the input dict.
        :param relationship: Represents what relationship conditions are
            imposed on the hypothesis test. A function or lambda function can
            be supplied.

            Available built-in relationships are: "greater_than", "less_than",
            "not_equal" or "equal", where "equal" is the null hypothesis.

            If callable, the input function signature should have the signature
            ``(stat: float, pvalue: float, **kwargs)`` where `stat` is the
            hypothesis test statistic, `pvalue` assesses statistical
            significance, and `**kwargs` are other arguments supplied via the
            `**relationship_kwargs` argument.

            Default is "equal" for the null hypothesis.
        :param alpha: significance level, if applicable to the hypothesis check.
        :param dict test_kwargs: Keyword arguments to be supplied to the test.
        :param dict relationship_kwargs: Keyword arguments to be supplied to
            the relationship function. e.g. `alpha` could be used to specify a
            threshold in a t-test.
        :param name: optional name of hypothesis test
        :param error: error message to show
        :param raise_warning: if True, raise a SchemaWarning and do not throw
            exception instead of raising a SchemaError for a specific check.
            This option should be used carefully in cases where a failing
            check is informational and shouldn't stop execution of the program.
        :param n_failure_cases: report the first n unique failure cases. If
            None, report all failure cases.
        :param title: A human-readable label for the check.
        :param description: An arbitrary textual description of the check.
        :param statistics: kwargs to pass into the check function. These values
            are serialized and represent the constraints of the checks.
        :param strategy: A hypothesis strategy, used for implementing data
            synthesis strategies for this check.
        :param check_kwargs: key-word arguments to pass into ``check_fn``
